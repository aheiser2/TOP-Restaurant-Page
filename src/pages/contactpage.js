    The main image can be changed by either replacing the current image with another one of the same size (900x402), or using a new one of what ever dimensions you'd like. If you choose the latter, you must open up style.css and change the dimensions of #mainpic, as well as the file name if that is different. If you would like to move the heading around in the above image, find "#mainpic h1" in style.css and modify it's "left" and "top" properties, this is also true for the h2 tag.
